# Puzzle 1: constant add

This challenge is the first puzzle in our Daily Triton Challenge series. The goal is to write a Triton kernel that adds a constant value to each element of a vector. The key aspects of this puzzle are:

- **One program ID axis:** we use a 1D grid, with a single kernel instance.
- **Block size \(B_0\):** the block size is set equal to the length of the vector \(N_0\), so the kernel processes the entire vector in one go.
- **Verification:** the result is compared against a simple PyTorch implementation.

    constant,       # The constant value to add
    y_ptr,          # Pointer to the output vector y
    N0: tl.constexpr,      # Total number of elements in vector x (and y)
    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr  # Block size, set equal to N0
):
    # Each kernel instance processes a block of elements.
    # With BLOCK_SIZE equal to N0, only one instance is launched.
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    offsets = pid * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    mask = offsets < N0  # Ensure we don't access out-of-bound indices

    # Load x values, add the constant, and store the result in y
    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    y = x + constant
    tl.store(y_ptr + offsets, y, mask=mask)

## Code explanation

### 1. The Triton kernel (`constant_add_kernel`)
- **Kernel signature:**  
  the kernel receives pointers for the input vector `x`, the constant value to add, and the output vector `y`. It also gets the total number of elements `N0` and a compile-time constant `BLOCK_SIZE`.
  
- **Program ID and offsets:**  
  `pid = tl.program_id(0)` obtains the current program ID along the single grid axis. Using this, the kernel calculates the offsets for each element in the block. Since `BLOCK_SIZE` is set equal to `N0`, only one block (one kernel instance) is needed.
  
- **Boundary mask:**  
  a mask (`mask = offsets < N0`) ensures safe memory accesses.
  
- **Addition operation:**  
  the kernel loads the data from `x`, adds the provided constant, and stores the result into `y`.

### 2. Python wrapper function (`constant_add_triton`)
- **Purpose:**  
  this function allocates the output tensor and configures the grid for launching the Triton kernel.
  
- **Grid configuration:**  
  with `BLOCK_SIZE = N0`, the grid is defined as `(1,)` since the entire vector is processed by a single kernel instance.

### 3. Main routine
- **Setup:**  
  a vector `x` of length 1024 is created on the GPU, and a constant value of 3.0 is chosen.
  
- **Validation:**  
  the Triton kernelâ€™s output is compared to PyTorch's built-in addition to ensure correctness.

## Conclusion

Puzzle 1: Constant Add is the first step in our Daily Triton Challenge. This simple yet effective exercise helps you grasp the basic structure of writing a Triton kernel, setting up the grid, and ensuring correct memory operations. As you progress, you'll build on these fundamentals to explore more advanced topics in GPU kernel programming with Triton.
